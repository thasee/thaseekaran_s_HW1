This is a repo for the assignment.

## Thaseekaran

_Background_

Meet Thaseekaran from Sri Lanka, where the spices are hot, and so is his love for coding – it's practically his soulmate! As a South Asian wizard of web development, he decided to spice things up in Canada by creating a Tamil date website. When asked about his secret ingredient, he simply grinned and said, "It's all in the code, baby – just like a good curry, but in English!"
